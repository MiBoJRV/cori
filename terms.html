            Conditions, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. Any invalidity, illegality,
            or unenforceability of a provision in one jurisdiction shall not affect its validity, legality, or

            CS, constitute the entire agreement between the user and CS regarding the use of CS's services,

            shall have any force or effect. Any modifications or amendments to these Terms and Conditions must be made
            in writing and signed by an authorized representative of CS.</p>
        <p>Users acknowledge and agree that any terms or conditions contained in documents provided by the user,
            including but not limited to purchase orders, acknowledgments, or other similar documents, shall have no
            force or effect unless specifically agreed to in writing by CS.</p>
        <p>In the event of any inconsistency or conflict between these Terms and Conditions and any other agreement or
            policy provided by CS, these Terms and Conditions shall prevail unless expressly stated otherwise by CS in
